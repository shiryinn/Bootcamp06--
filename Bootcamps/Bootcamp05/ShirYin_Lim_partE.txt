Throwing Exceptions

Pros: Separate error-handling codes from the normal application, making the code more readable and robust. Able to handle specific type of exceptions.

Cons: Throwing exceptions can trap only runtime errors.


Static Factory Methods

Pros: The value will not pass through the getInstance method if the value does not meet the condition. Throwing exceptions is not necessary in static factory methods.

Cons: We are not able to know what kind of errors we are handling.
