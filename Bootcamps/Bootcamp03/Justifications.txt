StudentID = 0 when there is another student adds in, it will just run StudentID ++, which is simpler to implement.Disadvantages of using numeric integer type:- Since its return type is int means what the user can see is only in int. If there isn�t stated its for ID, users might not know anything about what this int means.Advantages of using Java string:- We can make it unique by adding numbers inside, for example, studentID = �ShirYinLim31059546�. It can be shown this way if Java string is implemented for IDs, which makes the user knows clearly what does the ID shows.Disadvantages of using Java string:- We might need to hard code using Java string for IDs as it cannot be incremented easily like int - Eg. studentID = �31059546�, we cannot increment it by adding 1, which makes things hard.
